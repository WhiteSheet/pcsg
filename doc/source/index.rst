*pcsg* - a constructive solid geometry library for Python
=========================================================

Constructive geometry is a technique used for modeling shapes and solids.
The **pcsg** library can be used to create 3D printable solid objects, images and animations utilizing tools like `OpenScad <https://www.openscad.org/>`_ and `POV-Ray <http://www.povray.org/>`_.
The introduction of a common description format eleminates the need for learning different scripting languages and rewriting your code.



.. warning::
   The current implementation of *pcsg* is a prototype.
   It's assumed that the API will change in future releases.
